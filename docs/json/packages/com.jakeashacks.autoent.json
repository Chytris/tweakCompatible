  "shortDescription": "Sign, add entitlements, fix permissions & unstash from /var all recent applications & binaries installed via Cydia in iOS 11, all automatically! Run \"autoentitle\" via SSH to get list of options. Automatic patching on installation is disabled by default, only enable if you have a clue how it works! If you plan on using manual patching, run \"autoentitle getlist\" and make sure that you wouldn't mind if any of the shown binaries is broken before attempting to fix. Although this tool has been tested multiple times with success & has security measures to prevent breaking a system binary, bugs might be present.",
