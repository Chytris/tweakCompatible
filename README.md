## Why was this made

Previously when a new jailbreak was released, the community manages a large google spreadsheet. The old process is super time consuming and tedious to cross reference against your device.

## What does it do

In the spirit of open source, I spent some time writing this tweak for Cydia that adds a search button to the right of the package details page. When clicked, it displays community driven compatibility info into an alert box.

With the iOS 11 jailbreak approaching, I rushed to finish this. I will be improving upon it and submitting to bigboss.

## Contributing

I openly accept pull requests. To add compatible tweaks edit `/docs/tweaks.json` following my format.

I am building a web frontend, https://jlippold.github.io/tweakCompatible/  which will simplify the pull request / submission process.

I also gladly welcome pull requests to the code base.

## Installing

Currently, an alpha deb is available here: https://github.com/jlippold/tweakCompatible/releases

Thanks to [HASHBANG](https://github.com/hbang) for open sourcing the now defunct tweak Pheromone. I learned and took a lot from them.
